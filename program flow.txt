1) Prompt user what type of structure to solve
    [1] Beams & Frames
    [2] Trusses

    For Beams & Frames:
        Prompt user option to plot
            [1] Support
            [2] Releases
            [3] Compute for degree of indeterminacy (Auto Compute)

Support Case:
    NOTE: Roller 1, Pin 2, Fixed 3 = Reactions
    Prompt if support is betweeen the member: Yes or No

    If yes:
        Member coordinate: x y, x y
    else:
        *** dont ask for member coordinate ***

    Prompt user what type of support to plot
        [1] Roller

        [2] Pin
            Pin Coordinate: x y

                [3] Left
                [4] Right
        [3] Fixed
            Fixed coordinate: x y
            alignment: 
                [1] horizontal
                [2] vertical

            validate if support coordinate is betweeen the member
        else:

Releases Case:
    NOTE: Hinge 1, Roller 2 = EC
